public pvt key 

bit and bytes 
bytes -- > 8 bits


bytes can have value that can go from 0 to 255 
and bit can have 0 or  1


UInt8Array([...,...,....]) -- use less space


pvt key. -- array of bytes -- 32 bytes
if 


ascii to bytes 
bytes to ascii 
of array using char and UInt8Array


what is ascii 
hex 
base64 
base58 



hex 1 chr == 4. bits
hex


in ascii you will get the twice the number of element than hexa


base64
1 chr --> 6 bits 


what is buffer 
and give me code to all these conversion 


base 58
is avoid visually similar looking character like i and l, 0 and o 
mostly public address use this



hashing and encryption 
difference between them 

hashing you cant go back 1 ways
encrypt can go back 2 ways (ciphertext, key) 
how encryption works? 

symetric encryption
asymetric encryption
