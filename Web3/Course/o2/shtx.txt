web based wallet? 
 

wht is UTF-8  ? 


hashing? 
algo for hasing -- SHA256 and MD5

 
symmmetric encryption -- same pvt key in encryption and decrytion 
symetric algo -- AES

asymetric encryption -- diff  key  {pvt and public }  -- ---- ---- used in cyrpto 

asysmmetric encryption algorithm 
RSA  -- rivest shamir adleman
Ecc -- elliptic curve crptography (ECDSA) - -ETH and BTC
EdSA - edwards curve digital singature algo -- SOL 




these algo depend on elliptic curve 
common elliptic curves?   
secp256k1 -- BTC and ETH 
ed25519 - SOL 

they use these algo to generate public key and pvt key

few use case 
SSL/TLS certificate 
SSH keys to connect to servers like github 
blockchains and cryptocurrencies


from the pvt key you can dervie the public key not vice versa


read the notes they are too imp
