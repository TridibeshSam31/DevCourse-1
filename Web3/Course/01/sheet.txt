why blockchain ? 

inflating currencies ? 
bailouts. ?

even big banks go down 


how inr going up against us dollar is bad ? 


why japaense currency ? here in cyrpto ? 


hashing function ? 
same input will always produce the same output
fast computation : the hash value can be quickly computed for any given data 
pre image resistance: computation infeasible 
small change in input do large change in output 


may be 2 input can raise to same output but thats have low lowest probability


hashing vs encryption difference ?


SHA - 256
its hashing algo 


const crypto = require('crypto');

const input = "111maa"
const hash = cyrpto.createHash('sha256').update(input).digest('hex');

console.log(hash)


sha 256. -- 2^256
have 256 bits 
why converted to 64 bits? as 1 byte. === 8 bits 


binary conversion or vice versa 

convert 16 into binary 



596138 -- gives 5 0s in starting
