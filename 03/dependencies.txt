mongoose --- 
mongodb -- is noSQL db 
that means it in document form, it doesnt have tables 
so basically its not structured. 

so make our mongodb db structure in form of table 
we use mongoose library 

it is wrapper for monogodb

because of this we can define schema(data structured)

----- analogy 
mongodb is like a blank notebook
moogoose is the table that tells how to write and read each page
