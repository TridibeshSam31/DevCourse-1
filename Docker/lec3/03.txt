Bind Mounts

By default:
Containers have their own filesystem inside.
Files donâ€™t change when you change them on your computer.

Bind mount = link a folder from your computer into the container.
So if you change a file on your computer, it instantly changes inside the container.

Why useful?

For development (hot reloading).
Example: you are coding a Node.js app. Instead of rebuilding image every time, you mount your project folder. Changes reflect instantly.


Hot Reloading
Hot reload = app automatically reloads when files change.
Example: you edit index.js, and the server reloads without restarting the container.
Bind mount + dev tool (like nodemon) = hot reloading.

So bind mount = bridge for files,
hot reload = magic that refreshes app automatically.


How to Mount Bind


Syntax in docker run:
docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container image_name
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app node bash

$(pwd) = current folder on your computer.
/app = where it appears inside container.
