Pushing to Docker Hub

Docker Hub = like GitHub but for container images.

Every user has a username/namespace.
You cannot push to the global namespace (like ubuntu or nginx) because those are official images maintained by Docker or organizations.
So you need your username prefix.


docker login
docker tag myapp myusername/myapp:1.0
docker push myusername/myapp:1.0


Now others can download it using:
docker pull myusername/myapp:1.0


Why not global namespace?
Because if anyone could push nginx, we wouldn’t know which is the real one. 
It would be unsafe. That’s why each user gets their own “folder”.


Docker Compose
Running one container is easy. But real apps need many:
Web server (Nginx)
Database (MySQL)
Backend service (Node.js, Python, etc.)

Without Compose, you must start each one with long docker run commands.
With Compose, you write a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) that describes all containers, networks, and volumes. Then run:


docker compose up

docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example


Now, with one command, both web and db start together.
So Compose = project manager for multiple containers.
