docker kill <container_id>
Think of a container like a small computer program running inside a box.
sometimes the program gets stuck or you want to stop it quickly.
docker kill is like pulling the power cable from that box.
The container stops immediately (without saving anything).

docker ps               # shows running containers
docker kill 123abc456   # stop container with id 123abc456

Difference with docker stop
stop → tells the program nicely “please shut down”.
kill → cuts the power instantly.



docker rmi <image_name>
An image is like the blueprint or recipe for making containers.
example: “Ubuntu 20.04 image” is a recipe for making Ubuntu containers.
rmi = remove image from your computer.

docker images           # see images
docker rmi ubuntu:20.04
if a container is still using that image, you cannot delete it until you remove the container.



docker exec
Once a container is running, you may want to go inside it.
exec = execute a command inside the running container.
Example: open a shell (like logging into a small computer):
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

-i = interactive (you can type).
-t = gives you a terminal.
/bin/bash = the shell inside Linux container.


when done, type
exit
