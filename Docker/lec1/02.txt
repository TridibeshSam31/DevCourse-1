history of docker? 
Docker was founded in 2008 as a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) company called dotCloud 
by Solomon Hykes, Kamel Founadi, and Sebastien Pahl in Paris, France. 
The company later incorporated in the United States in 2010 and 
participated in the Y Combinator accelerator program during the summer batch of 2010.

Initially, dotCloud focused on providing a PaaS solution for developers to 
build and deploy applications. However, during the development process, 
the team realized the potential of the underlying container technology they were using, 
which later became known as Docker.
 

Installing Docker

docker version: Displays the version of Docker installed on your system.

docker run hello-world: Runs the hello-world Docker image, which is a simple container that prints a message and exits.

docker pull <image>: Pulls (downloads) a Docker image from a registry (e.g., docker pull nginx).

docker images: Lists the Docker images available on your local system.

docker ps: Lists the currently running Docker containers.


Docker Engine:
The Docker Engine is the core component of Docker, 
responsible for creating and managing containers. 
It is an open-source containerization technology that allows developers 
to package applications into containers.

Containers are standardized executable components that combine application 
source code with the required operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies.
This allows containers to run consistently across different environments, 
ensuring portability and reproducibility.



Docker CLI (Command Line Interface):
The Docker CLI is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with 
the Docker Engine. It provides a set of commands that enable you to 
perform various operations, such as starting, stopping, listing, 
and managing containers.

Docker Registry:
The Docker Registry is a service that stores and distributes Docker images. 
It acts as a central repository where you can push and pull Docker images.

Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/) is the main public Docker registry 
maintained by Docker, Inc. It hosts a vast collection of Docker images contributed by the community and various organizations.

For example, the official MongoDB image can be found on Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo.

In addition to Docker Hub, you can also set up private Docker registries within 
your organization or use third-party registry services like 
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Container Registry (GCR), 
or Azure Container Registry.


The Docker Engine provides the core containerization functionality, 
the Docker CLI allows you to interact with the Engine, and 
the Docker Registry serves as a central repository for storing and distributing Docker images.
