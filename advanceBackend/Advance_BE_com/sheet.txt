as your application grows you don't want to put everything in a single backend server 
and async process like notification on phone 
primary backend server be worry about it 


what are microservices. ? 

how do backends talk ? 
http 
queue
web socket 
pub sub 

when these 4 use case and when they make sense and what are their cons ? 

example of queue in paytm(their notification) and leetcode(their submission)

when you are waiting for a response from the another sever --> Synchronous
Asynchronous  -- weak coupling 
messaging queues
pub subs 
server-sent events (debatable)  -- explain why debatable
