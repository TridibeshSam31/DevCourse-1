//starting now 

there was a blog post related to  this that suppose we are using  prisma orm in a certain project and we have to deploy it on cloudflare
(serverless) so what does in actual prisma expects us to do 

basically it want us that when we are using cloudfare for deploying the project it want us not to connect directly with a database 
why not to do that whats the error in that ???

what prisma whats is that , since there are multiple workers in cloudfare when they will connect to the database it will create load on the database
so what it wants that all the workers send request to a single place(connection pool) ahd then that single place(pool) will connect to our datavbase
 
This will not create multiple connections to aur database and there will be a single connection

In the docs there were words like edge servers they are nothing it is means serverless only 


prisma wants us to use prisma accelerate in order to deploy a project to cloudflare 
for that read the docs and set up prisma accelerate 



I did the same thing and started an cloudflare applicartion connectionpool
