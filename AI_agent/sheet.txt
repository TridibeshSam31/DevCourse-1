Principles of Building AI agent
 
Graph-based Workflows have emerged as a
useful technique for building with LLMs when
agents don’t deliver predictable enough output.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
covers a common pattern of LLM-driven search.

how RAG works? 

Multi-agent systems cover the coordination
aspects of bringing agents into production. The
problems often involve a significant amount of orga-
nizational design!

Testing with Evals

Local dev and serverless deployment

we don’t talk about traditional
machine learning (ML) topics like reinforcement
learning, training models, and fine-tuning.
beacuase Today most AI applications only need to use
LLMs, rather than build them.
