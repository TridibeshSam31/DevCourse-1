Hosted vs open-source

what is hosted provider 

if you think you will need to use open-
source, prototype with cloud APIs, or you’ll be

debugging infra issues instead of actually iterating
on your code.


what is model routing library? 



Model size: accuracy vs cost/latency
Large language models work by multiplying arrays
and matrixes of numbers together. Each provider

has larger models, which are more expensive, accu-
rate, and slower, and smaller models, which are

faster, cheaper, and less accurate.



Context window size
what is this and why ? 
what is early prototyping 


Right now, the longest context windows belong
to the Google Gemini Flash set of models; Gemini
Flash 1.5 Pro supports a 2 million token context
window (roughly 4,000 pages of text).


Reasoning models
Another type of model is what’s called a “reasoning
model”, namely, that it does a lot of logic internally
before returning a response. It might take seconds,
or minutes, to give a response, and it will return a
response all at once (while streaming some
“thinking steps” along the way).

now-a-days how reasoning models are getting better? 
techniques like chain-of-thought prompting
“chain of draft” and 
“chain of preference optimization”
