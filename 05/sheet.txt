Authentication 

what is Authentication? 
any idea ?
 
q --- what is diff between Authentication and authorization ? 
ans -- Authentication verifies who someone is, 
while authorization determines what they are allowed 
to do after authentication is successful



the process of letting users sign in/sign out of your website
making sure routes are protected and users can only get back their own 
data and not the data from a diff user 

key topics :::::: 

auth 
jwt 
authorization header 
auth middleware 
localstorage 

----------------------------------------------------
how does the auth workflow works ? 


signin page.                  BE 



dashboard.                    BE 


signin page pr jaate h 
uthhr username password bnate h , login bhi hojate h
fir vo BE ko jata h 
fir BE token deta h


fir hum dashboard ki taraf jate h 
uthr jate he api calling start hojati h 
aur api calling me token sath me jata h 
aur us token ki vajah se /courses vhi dekhte h , naki hr kesi ke 


---------------------------------------------------------
the user come to your website 
the user sends request to /signin with their usernamee and password 
username -- jha 
pasword -- @RoyalBihari -- this pass will be hashed 
it will be hashed password 

it sends to the server
server gives you token 

then in every subsequent request, user sends the token to identify itself 
to the BE/server


Token -- secret that server gives you 
aur tum server ko vo secret vapas bhjte ho in every request 
so that server ko pta lge tum KON ho
